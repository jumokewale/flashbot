**Flashbot Token Transfer README**

**Introduction:**
This README provides instructions on how to use the Flashbot Token Transfer tool. This tool allows you to automatically remove a token from a wallet using a flashbot.

**Instructions:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the Flashbot Token Transfer repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Navigate to the cloned repository directory and install the required dependencies by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Add the following environment variables:
   ```
   PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>
   TOKEN_ADDRESS=<token-contract-address>
   NEW_WALLET_ADDRESS=<new-wallet-address>
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   Once you've set up the environment, you can run the script to initiate the token transfer. Execute the following command:
   ```
   node flashbot-token-transfer.js
   ```

5. **Confirmation:**
   The script will execute the token transfer using the provided private key, token contract address, and new wallet address. Once the transfer is complete, you should receive a confirmation message.

**Note:**
- Ensure that the provided private key has sufficient funds to cover gas fees for the transaction.
- Double-check the token contract address and new wallet address to avoid unintended transfers.
- This tool utilizes the flashbot technique for transaction execution, which bypasses the mempool and directly interacts with miners. Be aware of the implications and risks associated with using flashbots.
